# Emulator world and keybindings

Steam deck has done a lot of things to port PC games to Linux. Most works are around Proton, a Wine fork which supports DirectX features.

EmuDeck has a list of supported emulators.

Many games can be downloaded for emulators, and played on various platforms.

Arch Wiki contains a section around Gamepad.

Keyboard can handle all gamepad functions, no mouse required.

It turned out that I hate emulators. I do not want to download separate games and set them up just for random inputs. If that is the case, we should make it much more convenient and error resistant.

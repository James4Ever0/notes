# Problem of using Soly XM3 as noise reducer at sleep

This device is wireless, but it does not mean you can use it wirelessly without connection. You must either connect it wirelessly to some other device or you have to plug in the audio wire (no device needed) in order to prevent it from automatic shutdown. It would be annoying if it shuts down when you had almost fallen asleep.

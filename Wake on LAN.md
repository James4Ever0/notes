# Wake on LAN

If there is no light when your computer is suspended or off, then there is no way to WOL no matter how.

Some devices provide USB wakeup functionality in BIOS, usually keyboard based. You need to plug it in while awake.

To utilize this you need to use a device like OrangePi H3 or Raspberry Pi Zero with USB slave capable ports, such as USB-C, micro-USB etc. Some device like OneCloud or Raspberry Model A has a USB-A slave port.

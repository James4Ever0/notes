# Gooey: Argparse as GUI

Directly convert commandline programs as GUI programs.

This goofy name is so strange that even ChatGPT and search engine like Bing failed to retrieve.

Yet we manage to recover it from our legacy codebase `AGI/AutoUP/generator/transcribe`.

Is this fate? Or is the end, or new beginning?

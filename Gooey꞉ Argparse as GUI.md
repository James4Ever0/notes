# Gooey: Argparse as GUI

Directly convert commandline programs as GUI programs.

This goofy name "[Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) is so strange that even ChatGPT and search engine like Bing have both failed to retrieve.

Yet we manage to recover it from our legacy codebase `AGI/AutoUP/generator/transcribe`.

Is this fate? Or is the end, or new beginning?

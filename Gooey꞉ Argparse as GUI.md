# Gooey: Argparse as GUI

Directly convert commandline programs as GUI programs.

This goofy name "[Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)" is so strange that even ChatGPT and search engine like Bing have both failed to retrieve.

Yet we manage to recover it from our legacy codebase `AGI/AutoUP/generator/transcribe` by  `rg -g *.cmd pyinstaller36` and `find . | rg time | rg tracker`.

Is this fate? 

Is this the end, or the new beginning?

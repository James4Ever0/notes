Smart contract in EVM might be overkill, but it comes with the advantage of multiuser security.

A central solution might be [beanie](https://beanie.dev/), an ODM (Object Document Mapper) in MongoDB, or [pyneo4j-ogm](https://pypi.org/project/pyneo4j-ogm), an OGM (Object Graph Mapper) in Neo4j

Playstation emulators can emulate up to PS5.

There are two Xbox emulators around. One is [xemu](https://xemu.app), the original or the first Xbox emulator, which can run almost on any platform. The game for it can be downloaded at [the vault](https://vimm.net). The other is [xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia) or the Xbox 360 emulator, which can only be running on top of Windows 10+.

Xbox 360 is hackable and the game for it can be downloaded as GOD format.

[Greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/greenlight) is an electron app for local Xbox streaming and XGPU cloud gaming, supports multiple platforms.

To train a gaming AI and get potential financial rewards:

Buy a gaming console like Xbox Series S and use Arduino Leonardo or ESP32 to send gamepad signal. However since you do not have the authority to mimic official gamepad this might fail. 

You may also use HID to gamepad hardware. 

Make sure you do not delete the game accidentally. You may design such mechanism to prevent exiting the game and misbehave. You can create child accounts to prevent unwanted purchase.

Use Xbox 360 Emulator instead of running a real one.

Blockchain or Web3 is not silver bullet. Anything on Web3 can just be done in Web2 in centralized way.

Still smart contract compiler does not have Python API generator.

Local node: Geth, Hardhat, Ganache

Development environment: Ape, Brownie

Smart contract language: Solidity, Vyper

You have posted a lot of ideas into your QQ, WeChat, bookmarks and Bilibili favourites. Consider using tools to retrieve them?

卡点视频可以用Magenta Studio之类的MIDI生成模型或者时序输出模型来做，卡时间节点。

I hate Linkedin and Twitter. They both ban my accounts for no goddamn reason. Newly registered accounts shall do no operation for a long time before using features like browsing, following.

Consider finding some alternative platforms for job finding (remote work: V2EX, crypto careers, [web3.career](https://web3.career)) and social network.

Use smart contract like `sui move` for auto re-execution of automated (agentic) video generation scripts and hacking scripts, reward these scripts for successful task fulfillment (view count bypassing 1000; ssh login success; crypto currency obtained), and punish or ban these scripts at failed condition.

Human execution will be recorded for automated execution, and it is free. Automated init execution will only be granted once.

Notice you do not want overflow errors in the smart contract.

Use retrieval system with chat history while building the chatbot. Mind different index modes in llamaindex, in order to better capture consecutive context range with dynamic sliding window size.

---

Tachiyomi is for free manga reading, and manga narriative video. Its plugin store has been removed and requires you to search for workarounds.

---

Deep recursive thoughts and subconscious operators like `REM` and `DELEGATE` might help for making the agent to think for itself, becoming conscious.

Tornado cash is for crypto mixing and now it is public archive. Alternatives are:

- Aztec zk.money
- Monero 0xTIP
- Messier 87
- Cyclone Protocol
- RenBridge

Use vimgolf for collecting vim usage data to train cybergod, however the cli sucks and requires learning the javascript request headers from browser.

[vanna.ai](https://vanna.ai) can work as sql agent. what can generate cypher query for neo4j?

---

[Coroutines and tasks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) (`asyncio.create_task`) can save time. You can also make blocking actions non-blocking by `asyncio.to_thread`.

---

[InternLM-XComposer](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer) seems to be better than CogVLM, and can generate [image with text interleaving articles](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/WillowBreeze/InternLM-XComposer).

The platform [openxlab](https://openxlab.org.cn) is a huggingface clone, and maybe it can prvide some model execution service.

A better alternative for SadTalker: [Dream-Talk](https://magic-research.github.io/dream-talk/) (still single image generation).

[Audio2Gesture](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_audio2gesture.html) (pose generation by audio) can be exported to Metahuman.

# Cats video with lyrics (Lyrics)

Again i want to start finding lyrics, tired of sourcing & analyzing videos.

again found in github.

netease music's apis have been reverse engineered on github.
https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi

what about spotify apis?
https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node (credentials are optional)
https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js
https://github.com/plamere/spotipy

https://github.com/0xHJK/music-dl

also its proxy scraper.

pip3 install pymusic-dl

write a redirect plugin in tampermonkey, from github to hub.fastgit.org

again, done by you-get. but how do we search the uri? you need to dig into the music_dl.

so we are done in preposessing or anything?

now we need to find a bunch of cats.

cats are found on weibo.

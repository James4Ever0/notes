# Search Engines DIY

I bet there are many many alternatives. even for a relational database or graph database it can be a search engine by its nature.

search for search engine in github.

search engines are related to spiders/crawlers.

how to utilize these search engines is a problem. use url filters, generic extractors, readbility.js.

many specialized search engines that can search image, video and audio. one example is Jina

TypeSense:
dedicated client for every popular programminhg language
consume much fewer ram than meilisearch
need to write custom web interface via nodejs
upload data via client api

MeiliSearch:
good for small dataset
consume whoopy 900mb for my 9mb json dataset.
has intuitive web interface.
upload document via web post.

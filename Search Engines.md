# Search Engines DIY

I bet there are many many alternatives. even for a relational database or graph database it can be a search engine by its nature.

how the heck can i search my own notes? slice it into little segments? standard excerpt included.

search for search engine in github.

search engines are related to spiders/crawlers.

how to utilize these search engines is a problem/challenge. use url filters, generic extractors, readbility.js, summarizers like sumy.

many specialized search engines that can search image, video and audio. one example is Jina

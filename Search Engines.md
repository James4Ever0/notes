# Search Engines DIY

I bet there are many many alternatives. even for a relational database or graph database it can be a search engine by its nature.

how the heck can i search my own notes? slice it into little segments? standard excerpt included.

do you need to export your own good old notes? i mean mi notes. 2 phone numbers, 2 accounts. one with physical storage. the other you may want to download the mi note app and extract in the same way.

search for search engine in github.

search engines are related to spiders/crawlers.

how to utilize these search engines is a problem/challenge. use url filters, generic extractors, readbility.js, summarizers like sumy.

many specialized search engines that can search image, video and audio. one example is Jina

TypeSense:
dedicated client for every popular programminhg language
consume much fewer ram than meilisearch
need to write custom web interface via nodejs
upload data via client api

MeiliSearch:
good for small dataset
consume whoopy 900mb for my 9mb json dataset.
has intuitive web interface.
upload document via web post.

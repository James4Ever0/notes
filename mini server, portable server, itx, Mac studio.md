# mini server, portable server, itx, Mac studio

says that the cost of building some mini-itx with enormous ram costs a lot (more than te mac studio), and with a lot of headaches with custom designing, cnc and stl. worth it?

also the power consumption will be higher than mac studio.

assemble the machine with proper thermo, wires and some open space, then enclose the thing with design.


the weight:

mac studio (m1 ultra) for 3.6kg 

mini-itx machine: 6.3 kg - 10 kg (won't lose weight)

## graphic cards

a100 80g
a16 64g (with self-designed thermal solution)

## mother boards

Asrock X299e-itx using 4 mini ram slots
ASROCK X570D4I-2T
AsRock Rack E3C246D4I-2T Mini-ITX Server Motherboard Intel LGA 1151 C246

## thermo solutions
### cpu
### gpu

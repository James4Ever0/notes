# Several ways to have dynamic IP addresses

- restart main router using scheduled power switches
- use router with global proxy functionality
- use local proxy with socks5 and proxychains
- use powerful wifi card, wifi signal amplifier and yagi antenna to crack and connect to neighboring wifi

having dynamic ip addresses is just part of the procedure. to leave no trace you have to use a dedicated machine with dedicated network connection, doing nothing relevant to personal info.

public wifi will have less signal if clients are too many.

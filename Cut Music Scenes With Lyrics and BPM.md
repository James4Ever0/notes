# Cut Music Segments With Lyrics and BPM

def compare(a,b,reverse=False):


seg_low, seg_high = get_allowed_segments(bpm, low, high, tolerance=0.8) # the tolerance is compared with a common function called compare. it can be customized to output only value >=1 or vice versa.
candidates = sorted_lyrics_nearby_bpm_candidates + sorted_remained_bpm_candidates # priortize lyrics candidates.

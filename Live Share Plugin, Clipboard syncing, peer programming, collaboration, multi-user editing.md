# Live Share Plugin, Clipboard syncing, peer programming, collaboration, multi-user editing

live share will always create a invitation link upon starting, so you can use clipboard listener based on event listeners or [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) (repeatedly checking content in clipboard, see if there's any change), save the link to server or send via email.

----

if clipboard is not your thing, there's [a massive anyIM-to-Matrix list](https://www.matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now)

you can also setup your own sync app via [instant messaging](https://github.com/topics/instant-messaging) services.

# Emulator world and keybindings, video resources collection

Configuration file might be found after first launch, and `xemu` is at `/root/.local/share/xemu/xemu/xemu.toml`

You may collect video resource from random computer actions and semantically indexed, but better be partially guided by LLM, since that makes more sense even inside a small video excerpt.

Downloading games from [Romsfun](https://romsfun.com) is fast.

Steam deck has done a lot of things to port PC games to Linux. Most works are around Proton, a Wine fork which supports DirectX features.

EmuDeck has a list of supported emulators.

Many games can be downloaded for emulators, and played on various platforms.

Arch Wiki contains a section around gamepad.

Keyboard can handle all gamepad functions, no mouse required.

It turned out that I hate emulators. I do not want to download separate games and set them up just for random inputs. If that is the case, we should make it much more convenient and error resistant.

I do not want to buy a physical console like Xbox Series S along with a strange HID to gamepad adaptor. It will not accelerate the development of cybergod.

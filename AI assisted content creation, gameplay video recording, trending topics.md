Use `streamlit` to write interactive interfaces for video labeling, editing and registration, tracking viewer counts.

Grided image can be used for image selection and image condensation, putting multiple images together to save processing power during tasks like video rating.

When you play video games on low end devices, you can tune down the resolution and image quality, to ensure 30 FPS.

If you change screen resolution during screen recording, you might lose your view.

# Why AGI shall be CUA centric

CUA tasks can be made extremely difficult, yet very practical, easy to verify and observable.

CUA basically provide the tools for learning and the tasks to be solved simulateously, therefore have almost infinite saturation threshold.

CUA agents can easily be used in other environments, while other specialized agents cannot do the same.

CUA environments often require the agent to self-explore and evolve indefinitely, self-modification which is required for AGI.

CUA agents can eventually replace human computer users, which are already AGI by themselves.

CUA agents can orchestrate latest software tools and other tool AI, solve real world problem indefinitely.

# CPU Overheating (temperature too high)

## linux

[throttling cpu frequencies by temperature incrementally](https://github.com/Sepero/temp-throttle)

the desired temperature is 60.

usually when one throttles the CPU temperature, the GPU cannot be overheated.

it is turning my core i7 into a pentium 3! but not entirely cumbersome.

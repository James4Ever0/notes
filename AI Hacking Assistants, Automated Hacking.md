Many [pentesting models](https://hf-mirror.com/models?search=pentest) and [datasets](https://hf-mirror.com/datasets?search=pentest) are released on huggingface. Query words are: `pentest` `0dai`

0dAI has published [a series of models](https://hf-mirror.com/0dAI) and is available on [ollama](https://ollama.com/jjflores/0dai-v2).

Tutorial on how to use it:

It may worth while to collect tool manuals, tutorials, books, security blog posts, and train your custom AI upon them. It works best to let AI interacts with and learns from both simulated and real world environments.

But always remember hacking is an adversarial and highly competitive activity. It involves both high level and low level knowledge and expertise.

Always keep your knowledge base up to date in order to make use of latest vulnerabilities.

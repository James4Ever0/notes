[ctfwiki's intro on CGC](https://ctf-wiki.org/introduction/cgc/)

[cgc's github repo](https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge) and [website](http://cybergrandchallenge.com/)

[cyber-challenge](https://github.com/jamespic/cyber-challenge) Some toy examples, to demonstrate ideas that could be used in DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge including modifying java bytecode and filter out html requests on the fly

[EVIL](https://github.com/dessertlab/EVIL) (Exploiting software VIa natural Language) is an approach to automatically generate software exploits in assembly/Python language from descriptions in natural language. The approach leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques and a dataset that we developed for this work.

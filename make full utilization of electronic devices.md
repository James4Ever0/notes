# make full utilization of electronic devices

every electric device needs an user, and the user is typically human. if the devices are all designed for human, like mp4 player, notebook computers, pc desktop, but only one human user is present, we need to make some programmatic changes to mimic the human user, to fully utilize the device.

If the device is for hosting web pages or web services, then it must be connected with internet and has active human or program users. if no enough such user present, then we need to minic such users.

If the device is running some long going process, then we must make sure to get the final product somehow meaningful in the end. if only one human is the final perceived, then we must make some changes to mimic human feedback, to ensure the quality of end product, if the product is massive.

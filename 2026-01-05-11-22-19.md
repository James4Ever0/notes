extruder types:

bowden tube "remote" extruder vs close range extruder

extruder tubing:

PTFE can only withstand 260 Celsius 

Metal tubing usually titanium or stainless steel with heatsink can withstand higher temperature 

printing temperature:

pla < petg < abs < pet

PET requires higher temperature than 260 Celsius.

support:

tree like support is better than normal

abs printing without shield:

enable higher nozzle temp, higher bed temp and enable draft shield

will be hazardous if one staying around. need enclosure 

petg not sticking with pei plate:

higher temp, skirt, support

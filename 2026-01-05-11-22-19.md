# 3d printing

printers:

closed-source firmware

- bambu lab p1s
- bambu lab a1
- bambu lab a1 mini

open source firmware available, like marlin, klipper

- creality ender 3s
- ultimaker 2+ extended (not recommended)

extruder types:

bowden tube "remote" extruder vs close range extruder

extruder tubing:

PTFE can only withstand 260 Celsius 

Metal tubing usually titanium or stainless steel with heatsink can withstand higher temperature 

printing temperature:

pla < petg < abs < pet

PET requires higher temperature than 260 Celsius.

support:

tree like support is better than normal

abs printing without shield:

enable higher nozzle temp, higher bed temp and enable draft shield

will be hazardous if one staying around. need enclosure 

petg not sticking with pei plate:

higher temp, skirt, tree support 

safety issues, shortcut, overheating:

use wire protector around frequently moving cables, or change them with longer, larger and softer cables, such as rvvv silicon wrapped wires.

both marlin and klipper need careful configuration over extrusion speed, filament diameter,

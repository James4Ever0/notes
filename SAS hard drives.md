# SAS hard drives

You need SAS to PCI-E cards, in order to use on conventional PC motherboards.

```

[LSI2008] (card) - [8087] (port) x2 - [8087 to SAS x4] (cable)

```

x4 cables only support disks up to 2T, 6Gb/s. x2 cables can support disks larger than 2T.

Make sure both ports are usable before shipping. Notice any blinking LEDs which may indicate unusable ports.

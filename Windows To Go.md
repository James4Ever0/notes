# Windows To Go

Use SLC USB pendrives with 4K reading supported controllers like 3280, 3281 and 2246XT.

Download ISO files to local disks, then copy to Ventoy. Only use those installable under WTG mode with Rufus.

You may want to use Tiny10/11 on 32G pendrives. Arxiv.org links can be downloaded with Thunder Downloader.

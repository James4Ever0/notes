# The immortal device

Either embed this programmable genetic device in the host or place it externally. Connect it to advanced AI for observation, analysis, calculation and experiments.

By swapping every single cell over the entire body, restoring DNA sequence based on initial config, we can beat many mutation caused diseases.

Using nano machines, micro in place biological containers, we can do many gene experiments all around the entire body.

Defeat disease when infected, spot issues before spreading, create antibodies and genetically engineered cells to counteract.

If the host is totally destroyed and the device is intact, the device can still restore the host biologically.

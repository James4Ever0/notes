# Video Cutting with captioners, video classifiers, audio classifier, audio categorizer

you can cut based on video highlights, usually generated by counting "replay overlaps", avaliable from youtube and bilibili, again needs supervised learning to recognize patterns and emit signals which we want

[COCA](https://github.com/lucidrains/CoCa-pytorch) using vit and palm for video captioning

[audio classifier tutorial](https://mpolinowski.github.io/docs/IoT-and-Machine-Learning/ML/2022-04-01-tensorflow-audio-classifier/2022-04-01/)

[audio tagger](https://github.com/AlexUserForVA/AudioTagger) visualize how audio classifier works

need to identify sounds like dog bark and gun shots, sobs, laughs. Open sourced.

May use sound analyzers.

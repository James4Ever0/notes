# Cloud based Github Web IDE, VSCode auto commit and lightweight terminal IDE

can we mount git repo as user filesystem?

browse github repo as remote filesystem(vscode insider):
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.remotehub

the vscode desktop is too resource heavy. though we have found a plugin to auto commit to git repo(only for vscode insider):

spacevim with [custom color theme]() and nerdfont installed.

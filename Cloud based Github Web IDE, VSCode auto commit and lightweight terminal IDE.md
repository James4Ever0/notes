# Cloud based Github Web IDE, VSCode auto commit and lightweight terminal IDE

can we mount git repo as user filesystem?

cloud based github ide includes gitpod.io, github.dev, pythonanywhere but these are with serious limitations, most importantly without autocommit or too restricted to write code.

browse github repo as remote filesystem(vscode insider):
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.remotehub

the vscode desktop is too resource heavy. though we have found [a plugin to auto commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emjio.git-auto-commit) that also has [a github repo](https://github.com/emjio/git-auto-commit) to git repo(only for vscode insider):

spacevim with [custom color theme](https://github.com/jordst/colorscheme) and nerdfont installed.

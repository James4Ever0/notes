# stationary logo finders and moving logo finders

for stationary logo, we have a commandline tool called [logo finder](https://github.com/wernerturing/multi-delogo/blob/master/src/opencv-logo-finder/logo-finder.cpp) which can find multple stationary logos with different timespan. we also have [a repo for overall logo finding](https://github.com/rohitrango/automatic-watermark-detection), which might be deprecated.

for more, check out "Watermark Removal, Deep Image Prior, Inpainting, Generate Watermark Mask" bookmark folder in macbook chrome

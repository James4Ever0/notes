# Fcitx setup

Fcitx contains google-pinyin, which is the most reliable Chinese input method of all times.

You need to configure it after installation like described [here](https://christopher.sg/posts/manjaro-chinese-input-fcitx).

If all methods failed, please consider use tools like systemd or "Session and Startup" to force running command `fcitx` after startup.

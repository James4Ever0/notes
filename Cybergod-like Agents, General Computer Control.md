# Cybergod-like Agents, General Computer Control

[gui agent model](https://hf-mirror.com/shuaishuaicdp/GUI-Vid) trained on gui-world

[gui agent datasets](https://hf-mirror.com/search/full-text?q=gui+agent&type=dataset) on huggingface

autocoder with pretrained models, has access to terminal:

https://github.com/bin123apple/AutoCoder

---

you can label the gui manually, write comments to each ui element and write exact operate steps about the exact execution steps.

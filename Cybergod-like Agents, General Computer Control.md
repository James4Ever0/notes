# Cybergod-like Agents, General Computer Contro

---

we can collect commandline help, manuals and man pages from web, operate systems like kali and generate task descriptions from the manual. the training method would be just like zerogui/opencua/seagent (rl)

we may use legacy code of metalazero for collecting man pages.

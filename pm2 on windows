convert all cmd/bat scripts into bash scripts

use `scoop install git` to install bash for windows

before `pm2 start -n <task_name> bash -- <script_path>` you would manually run the script first, to make sure it would not be a infinite daemonization loop which would freeze the computer

use task scheduler to invoke `pm2 resurrect` once on login

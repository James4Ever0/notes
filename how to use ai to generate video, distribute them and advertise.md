# how to use ai to generate video, distribute them and advertise

https://github.com/Saiyan-World/goku

notice: QA based websites are popular now. inspired by that and jumpcut, you can mine summaries/questions/prompts/examples relating to some topic, **generating answers/scripts from chatgpt** (imagination is the limit)

videos are similar by title, author and topic. you demand the bot to generate new embeddings by any "abstractive" means, giving sample embeddings (subtitles, voice, sentiment, music, scene), and output needed embeddings. cool!

There are a few different ways you can use AI to generate video content and distribute it for advertising purposes. Here are a few options:

Use an AI video creation tool: There are several AI tools available that allow you to input text, images, or other media and have the AI generate a video for you. These tools can be useful for creating promotional videos, explainer videos, or other types of content quickly and easily.

Use an AI-powered video editor: Some video editing software includes AI-powered features that can help you edit and enhance your videos more efficiently. For example, you might be able to use AI to automatically color grade your footage or to stabilize shaky video.

Use an AI-powered video platform: There are also platforms that use AI to optimize and distribute your video content for maximum reach and engagement. These platforms can help you target specific audiences, measure the effectiveness of your videos, and more.

It's important to note that while AI can be a useful tool for creating and distributing video content, it's not a replacement for human creativity and insight. The best results will often come from a combination of AI and human input.

## how can ai help you target specific audiences

There are several ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) can help target specific audiences:

Personalization: AI can analyze data on individuals and their preferences, and use that information to tailor content and messaging specifically to them. For example, an AI-powered recommendation engine can suggest products or content based on a user's past behaviors and interests.

Segmentation: AI can help to segment audiences into smaller, more specific groups based on shared characteristics, such as demographics, interests, or behaviors. This can allow organizations to create more targeted campaigns and messaging.

Predictive analytics: AI can analyze data on past behaviors and outcomes to make predictions about future behavior. This can help organizations to better understand their target audience and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.

Natural language processing: AI can analyze and understand human language, allowing organizations to use chatbots and other tools to communicate with their audience in a more personalized and natural way.

Image and video analysis: AI can analyze images and videos to understand the content and context, allowing organizations to target specific audiences based on the visual content they consume.

Overall, AI can be a powerful tool for targeting specific audiences by providing insights, personalization, and automation to marketing efforts.

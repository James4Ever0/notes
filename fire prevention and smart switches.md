# fire prevention and smart switches

锂电池充电防爆箱

----

use fire preventing sheets, use high quality cabels, use fire preventing cabel protectors around coils, spray fire preventing liquid

----

fire is detected multiple times and is now the major concern of all. even if you somehow find a little purpose from the machine, the machine can always burn for no reason at all. you need to stop it.

if the source is battery-less, cutting off the power can solve the problem. if it has battery, then you need to wait till its battery being drained (usually shortcut) and then ditch it.

fire or shortcut usually happens around those plugged or charged devices. unmanaged ones can cause dramatic catastrophics.

if you want distributed computing, safety need to be put into first place.

you need to always make sure that message service is always available to the supervisor.

we introduce some chain reaction like mechanism, to turn off corresponding wifi-connected switches when specific signal is received.

put temperature & smoke detectors and fireballs around many places, especially for those long-running machines. once fire detected, send alarm notification and switch off the main power controller.

fire countermeasure shall be linked to smart power switches (once triggered, cut off the power), and placed evenly to potential area

also human presence sensor shall be placed, to create more advanced logic, along with physical switches & power level based logic.

----

although it might be less likely to have devastating fire catastrophies inside if procedure mentioned above is done correctly, fire outside the domesticated area is also concerned.

we shall first make sure living objects can escape in time. once fire outside the room is detected, all important files shall be uploaded to the cloud. if fire is inside, cut off the power and use UPS to continue execution. make sure important data and devices can be carried around, and active countermeasures like firebots and firerolls will stop the propagation of fire (to isolate air from fire, even if fire is inside)

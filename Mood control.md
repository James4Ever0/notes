# Mood control

Sometimes I just feel very angry when the bed is too warm, losing control and have a very unstable mind. Maybe it will be better if wearing girl style suits, because that makes me cooler, literally.

Sometimes my mind is crazy just as if using a hammer smashing at my balls. It is like a testorons or adrenaline fest.

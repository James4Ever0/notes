# Mood control

Sometimes I just feel very angry when the bed is too warm, losing control and have a very unstable mind. Maybe it will be better if wearing girl style clothes, because that makes me cooler, literally. 

Always stay away from heated areas, no matter it is about temperature, noises or arguments.

Sometimes my mind is crazy just as if using a hammer smashing at my balls. It is like a testosterone or adrenaline fest. Maybe some female hormone will help.

To handle this kind of imminent stress, some additional help might be necessary.

A gulp of fresh air, a glass of cold water, air conditioner, strawberry gum, mint candies, oil and inhaler etc.

Some additional medicine or drug might help. Others including alcohol, cigerette, dope

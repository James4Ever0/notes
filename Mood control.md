# Mood control

Sometimes I just feel very angry when the bed is too warm, losing control and have a very unstable mind. Maybe it will be better if wearing girl style clothes, because that makes me cooler, literally. And always stay away from heated areas.

Sometimes my mind is crazy just as if using a hammer smashing at my balls. It is like a testosterone or adrenaline fest. Maybe some female hormone will help.

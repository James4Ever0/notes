# Seek for cooperation and solution sharing

I have been researching in automotive computers for years.

Topics that you might be interested in that I have dug into:

- [Q-Star Learning](https://github.com/estill01/open_qstar)
- [RT-2](https://github.com/James4Ever0/agi_computer_control/tree/master/rt_x_experiments) & [RT-X dataset](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/)
- [Automotive Learning Rate]()
- [Recursive Positional Encoding]()
- [Dynamic Reservoir Computing]()
- [Hardware Mouse/Keyboard Control]()
- [Physical HID Control]()
- [Bit-level Autoregressive Transformer]()
- [Browser-based AI Playground]()
- [Containerized Console and GUI AI Playground]()

I have dedicated repositories that you may be interested into:

- [agi-computer-control](https://github.com/James4Ever0/agi_computer_control): automotive computer, which can see, hear and operate
- [metalazero](https://gitee.com/x00e0d991e368/metalazero): multi-platform computer automation attempts

Other similar projects that I am monitoring:

- [GPT-4V-Act](https://github.com/ddupont808/GPT-4V-Act)
- [SingularGPT](https://github.com/abhiprojectz/SingularGPT)
- [gpt-eyes](https://github.com/Charmve/gpt-eyes)
- [gpt4v-browsing](https://github.com/unconv/gpt4v-browsing)
- [self-operating-computer](https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer)

Apologize for my unorganized code structure. I am trying to improve development experience by AI generated documentation & usage demonstration and client-side LLM & semantic search, which may solve this long-standing task among all my previous repositories.

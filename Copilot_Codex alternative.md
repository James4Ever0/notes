# Copilot/Codex alternative

use chatgpt instead, when it is free.

tsinghua (again!) introduced a similar open source model called [codegeex](https://github.com/THUDM/CodeGeeX), having better performance than [incoder](https://github.com/dpfried/incoder) (by meta) and codegen with vscode plugin support, able to generate and **translate** code. the info is found on [tuna events](https://tuna.moe/events/) and you can download video/scripts for some events. trained on [humaneval-x](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/humaneval-x) dataset for code generation. it also provides [blog](https://tuna.moe/blog/) and [podcast](https://podcast.tuna.moe/)

# Manual And Automatic Video Creation

The live streaming and the audio/music may need some transcription to be more efficient to manage and create.

---

Make inheritance of existing projects, in order to keep track of ideas and sort by average and total view counts per group.

---

Link your reusable part and ideas to statistics in order to find out the most efficient workflow.

---

For quickly testing your unique ideas, you can use manual video editing, save your workspace to specific folder, produce video alongside the project file, and upload it with specialized tool in order to keep track of the video.

If automatic upload is not "convenient" enough for you, consider manually input the video link afterwards.

Autotrack the video statistics after upload.

---

Link your live streaming workspace with the live streaming platform and streaming time, create a more accurate perspective about your actural impact to the audience.

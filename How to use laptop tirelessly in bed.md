# How to use laptop tirelessly in bed

```
   light cloth covering

   \
    pillow #1

You should sit on pillow #2, form a triangle with your knees, cover your legs with blanket, and put your laptop over the blanket.

Notice when using laptops with fans you should add another layer of thermal condictive device between your laptop and your blanket.

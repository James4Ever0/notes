gnn intro:
https://cnvrg.io/graph-neural-networks/

gnn applications:
    Node classification: The objective here is to predict the labels of nodes by considering the labels of their neighbors. 
    Link prediction: In this case, the goal is to predict the relationship between various entities in a graph. This can for example be applied in prediction connections for social networks. 
    Graph clustering: This involves dividing the nodes of a graph into clusters. The partitioning can be done based on edge weights or edge distances or by considering the graphs as objects and grouping similar objects together. 
    Graph classification: This entails classifying a graph into a category. This can be applied in social network analysis and categorizing documents in natural language processing. Other applications in NLP include text classification, extracting semantic relationships between texts, and sequence labeling. 
    Computer vision: In the computer vision world, GNNs can be used to generate regions of interest for object detection. They can also be used in image classification whereby a scene graph is generated. The scene generation model then identifies objects in the image and the semantic relationship between them. Other applications in this field include interaction detection and region classification.

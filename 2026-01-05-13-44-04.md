# cnc machining and manufacturing

freecad has path workbench or cam (computer aided manufacturing)

for machining more than 3 axises, use commercial cam software like mastercam or autodesk fusion

opencamlib is still in its early stages. most cam libraries use boolean operations.

angle grinder is very insecure. could cause permanent physical body damage to the user when used for cutting. use multimaster instead.

table saw is better than handheld saw.

things must be clamped tightly by claws, clamps, vises or custom fixture before processing, either by cnc machine or manual procedures.

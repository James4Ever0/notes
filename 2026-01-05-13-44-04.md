# cnc machining and manufacturing

freecad has path workbench or cam (computer aided manufacturing)

for machining with more than 3 axises, use commercial cam software like mastercam or autodesk fusion

opencamlib is still in its early stages. most cam libraries use boolean operations.

angle grinder is very insecure. could cause permanent physical body damage to the user when used for cutting. use multimaster instead. or you basically need to wear military fully covered body armor before processing.

table saw is better than handheld saw.

things must be clamped tightly by claws, clamps, vises or custom fixture before processing, either by cnc machine or manual procedures.

cylinder material can be used for shaft.

a three axis milling machine can be used as lathe if the workpiece is placed on the spindle, and the blade is placed on x-y plane.

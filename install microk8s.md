# install microk8s

```bash
sudo snap install --classic microk8s
sudo microk8s enable dns:<dns_ip>
```

config files are at `/var/snap/microk8s/current`, and you need to replace all `docker.io` with some docker mirror to prevent init errors.

run `microk8s inspect` to get errors like hostname casing, and missing file like `/var/snap/microk8s/current/var/kubernetes/backend/localnode.yaml`

you need to configure multiple registries for `docker.io` and `registry.k8s.io` under `/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/certs.d`

in order to use some mirror site which does not support `/v2` url, you have to add `override_path = true` in config

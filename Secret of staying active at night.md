# Secret of staying active at night

After a day's work you first need to rest in bed for a short period of time, ahead of anything else like taking shower, and remember not to fall asleep yet. After that get off the bed and resume your operation.

Similarly, you do not find a way to stay active in the midday but rather to sleep somewhere and laying on the mattress above ground is the best option. Remember to set alarm in case of sleeping overtime.

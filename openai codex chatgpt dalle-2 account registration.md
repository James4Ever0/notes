# openai codex chatgpt dalle-2 account registration

chatgpt is based on [instructGPT](https://gpt3demo.com/apps/instructgpt)

[chatgpt interface](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

there are discord chats for [openai](https://discord.gg/openai) and hackthebox

consider [bugmenot](http://bugmenot.com/view/openai.com) to find openai accounts?

chatgpt sucks. it seems a tailored search engine. it might help filter out useless information. no zeroday exploits (rasp like [openrasp](https://github.com/baidu/openrasp)) since it does not interact with program and hooks.

if you use openai to register new accounts, try to send sms successfully (may not receive sms even sent) multiple times, you will be blocked

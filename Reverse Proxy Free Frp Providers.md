# Reverse Proxy Free Frp Providers

currently we only have [one](https://www.idonglei.com/free-frp), which uses direct ip address instead of a hijacked domain. maybe it is time to consider some faster server providers.

use a universal ssh as workspace extension called [SSH FS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kelvin.vscode-sshfs)

to make sure the changes are updated regularly, we need a filesystem watchdog on kali, which will trigger the action of syncing, utilizing inotify. shall that be adopted on macos? maybe. but my only editor can be vim or nvim, so it is not so hard to predict.
